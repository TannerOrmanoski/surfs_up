# surfs_up

## Purpose

In this analysis, temperature data was queried for the months of June and December in Oahu. This temperature data will help our client W. Avy determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

When querying for these two months there were some key differences between them worth highlighting.

The first key difference was in the minimum temperature. The min temperature in June was 64 degrees, whereas the min in December was 56 degrees.

The maximum temperatures were also quite interesting. The max in June was 85 degrees, while the max in December was 83.

Finally, it is also prudent to mention the mean temperature. The mean in June was about 74 degrees and the mean was about 71 degrees for December. 

## Summary 

The differences in temperature led me to conclude that the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The biggest difference between the two months is seen in the minimum temperature. Since the minimum is an extreme for the month, it wouldn’t make much sense to put too much stock in this single variable. It is also logical to assume that this minimum temperature did not occur during mid-day, when most people would want to grab some ice cream and surf. The max temperature and the average temperature only had a 2- and 3-degree difference respectively. This small difference means that business should remain steady throughout the year. I further added a query for precipitation for the two months. This query showed that it rained more in the December, which might have a slight effect on the business, but it still shouldn’t prove to be a big enough factor to deter the business from running throughout the year.
